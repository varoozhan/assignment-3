1-Turning the above into a 0-1 matrix?

Q: how do i best represent this matrix?


2- minhash to sig matrix(Dims # of business to # of hash functions) => b x r(# of hash functions) = #minhash functions to create signatures = # signatures in the first place.
Q: Do we use the suggested hash functions? A:YES
Q: DO WE NEED all those zeros?
Q: since we have strings, should we hash the strings insread of the int example?



3- find b & r. b=#buckets=#hash functions?

Q:What is the best way to find b&r? probabilities? A:(1/b)^(1/r)=similarity threshold 0.502

five rows of one business and 5 rows of another business
hash() => int 
100 x 10
bucket size 5 rows
(it depends on the hash functions.)=> bxr=n
Since threshold 50% our b and r should be the same number?
higher is generally better since closer to step functon. but how high do we go?


4- Use Python hash function to get ints then divide matrix and hash each b to a bucket.
Q: 
is the bucket a hashable? 
what should the keys be? 
results of the hash function?


Q: Is there a set answer we need to get to? otherwise, submission fail?

Q: Can we use the hashfamily in the stack overflow post.

Q: Can we have .py files other than the task1.py, etc.
